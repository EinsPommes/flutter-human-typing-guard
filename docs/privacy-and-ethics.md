# Privacy & Ethics

We take privacy seriously. This document explains how we handle data.

## Our Privacy Promise

### What We Don't Do

1. **No personal data** - no names, emails, or identifying info
2. **No content storage** - we only look at timing patterns
3. **No tracking** - each session is anonymous
4. **No biometric ID** - this isn't biometric identification
5. **No data retention** - everything is processed in memory and thrown away

### What We Actually Do

- **Local analysis by default** - everything happens on your device
- **Only statistical features** - we calculate averages, not content
- **Temporary processing** - data exists only while analyzing
- **Optional server** - you can use it completely offline

## GDPR Compliance

### Legal Basis

The system can be used under different legal bases:

1. **Legitimate Interest**: For security and fraud prevention
2. **Consent**: When explicitly requested from users
3. **Contract**: When part of a service agreement

### User Rights

The system supports all GDPR user rights:

- **Right to Information**: Clear documentation of what data is processed
- **Right of Access**: Users can request information about processed data
- **Right to Rectification**: Users can correct or update their data
- **Right to Erasure**: No persistent data storage means automatic erasure
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: Users can disable analysis entirely
- **Right to Data Portability**: Users can export their analysis results
- **Right to Object**: Users can opt-out of analysis

### Data Protection by Design

1. **Privacy by Default**: Local analysis enabled by default
2. **Minimal Data**: Only necessary metrics are calculated
3. **Transparency**: Open source code for full transparency
4. **User Control**: Users have full control over data processing
5. **Security**: Strong encryption for any server communication

## Ethical Guidelines

### Fairness and Non-Discrimination

- **No Biometric Profiling**: Cannot create biometric profiles
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Configurable thresholds for different typing patterns
- **Accessibility**: Designed to work with assistive technologies
- **Language Agnostic**: Works with any character set

### Transparency

- **Open Source**: Complete source code available
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of algorithms
- **Research References**: Based on published research
- **Configurable**: Users can adjust sensitivity and thresholds

### User Autonomy

- **Opt-in Server**: Server analysis requires explicit opt-in
- **Configurable**: All parameters can be adjusted
- **Disable**: Can be completely disabled
- **Local Only**: Can operate entirely offline

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Obtain Consent**: Always obtain explicit consent for server analysis
2. **Provide Transparency**: Clearly explain what data is processed
3. **Allow Opt-out**: Provide easy opt-out mechanisms
4. **Respect Privacy**: Default to local-only analysis
5. **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS and HMAC for server communication

### For Organizations

1. **Privacy Impact Assessment**: Conduct PIA before deployment
2. **Data Protection Officer**: Consult DPO for compliance
3. **User Education**: Educate users about the system
4. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit compliance
5. **Incident Response**: Have procedures for data breaches

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All server communication uses TLS
- **HMAC Signatures**: Request authenticity verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **No Logging**: No persistent logging of user data

### Access Control

- **API Keys**: Secure API key management
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and per-session limits
- **CORS**: Configurable cross-origin policies
- **Authentication**: Optional HMAC-based authentication
